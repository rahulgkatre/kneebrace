# Smart Orthotics: Ubiquitous Knee Brace

### Abstract
Uncorrected knee mobility issues can develop and lead to more concerning conditions such as arthritis, and getting the proper treatment for these issues can be expensive and time-consuming. To address these problems, we introduce a method for assisted out-patient knee recovery, applying common sensor technology to widely used, cheap and accessible knee braces. The smart knee brace is an off-the-shelf soft knee brace, augmented with an inertial measurement unit (IMU), flex sensor, haptic feedback, and onboard processing to display gait information and other metrics to a user interface. The result is a low-cost wearable sensor platform that has the potential to aid patients and physical therapists in improving the quality of life of those wearing knee orthotics by reducing the number of in-person checkups with health practitioners.
